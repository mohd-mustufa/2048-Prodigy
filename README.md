## Game Guidelines

1. Click on the 2048 Prodigy icon in your Chrome toolbar.
2. The game is played on a 4x4 grid with numbered tiles that smoothly slide when moved using the arrow keys.
3. A new tile with a value of either 2 or 4 appears randomly in an empty spot on the board every turn.
4. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until reaching the grid's edge or colliding with another tile.
5. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles. The resulting tile cannot merge again in the same move.
6. The game concludes when the grid is full, and no further moves are possible.
